## Accessibility-First Composition

- Always render semantic HTML (`<button>`, `<a>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`) before reaching for `role` attributes
- Every interactive element must be reachable by keyboard
- Form inputs need labels — `<label htmlFor>` or `aria-label` if visually labeled by an icon
- Manage focus on route changes and modal open/close
- Run `axe` in component tests (see [skills/react-testing](../react-testing/SKILL.md))
- Cross-link: [skills/accessibility/SKILL.md](../accessibility/SKILL.md) covers WCAG criteria and pattern libraries
